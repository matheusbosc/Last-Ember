# Last Ember

In Last Ember, you control a caveman trying to survive on Earth. You are alone. To continue surviving, you need warmth and light.

Collect sticks around the map to keep your fire alive while events like rain and wind attempt to put out your fire. Take advantage of the time you have in between events to collect even more sticks to survive.

Survive for as long as you can and enter the leaderboard!
